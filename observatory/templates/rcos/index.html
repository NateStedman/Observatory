<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>
	To provide a creative, intellectual and entrepreneurial outlet for
	students to use the latest open-source software platforms to develop
	applications that solve societal problems.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	RCOS is a group of RPI students who work on open source projects. We meet every Friday in JEC 3117 from 4pm - 5pm (during regular semester) and Friday from noon to 1:00 pm  (during summer) in <b> Lally 104 </b> to update our progress.  
	Our members work on a variety of projects, as can be seen <a href="http://rcos.cs.rpi.edu/projects/">here</a>. The projects page is itself our dashboard to help us keep up with the status of the projects!</a>
</p>

<h2>Benefits of being an RCOS member</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The opportunity to help society by creating useful software.</li>
	<li>An excellent environment to share your skills with your peers and
		learn from them as well</li>
	<li>Great practice in the code review process, a very important skill
		for your software career!</li>
	<li>Practice giving and receiving feedback. Learning how to discuss
		technical and non-technical aspects of a project in a constructive
		fashion is a critical skill that employers look for!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>
	Students can participate in RCOS for course credit or for a stipend.
	At the beginning of each semester, the Internal Advisory Board will
	review project proposals and decide which projects should receive
	financial support.
