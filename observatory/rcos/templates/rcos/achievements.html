<b> Ethan Bond, Raymond Jacobson '16 (freshmen)</b> won second place in the recently concluded Hackathon at Syracuse on April 7,8, 2013.
<a href="http://infospace.ischool.syr.edu/2013/04/09/hack-upstate-brings-together-tech-talent-from-across-new-york/"> Syracuse paper article</a>
From that paper "Two freshman from Rensalear Polytechnic  Institute have tackled file sharing as well, though with an entirely different model.  
Users create a temporary “bubbl” for their projects.  The bubbl will be available to anyone with an internet connection and a link, and will expire after seven days of idleness. The tradeoff for minimal security? No time wasted on user authentication.""
Congratulations to <h2> Ethan and Raymond </h2>

Congratulations to <b> Diogo Moitinho de Almeida</b> for a RPI team member of Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling and is run by COMAP 
which won the outstanding award (one among the five among 957 teams) at the competition this year (2013).
Their paper employed a data-driven, machine learning approach to model the Earth Damage Score, representing estimated 
economic loss from natural disasters in terms of human activity variables, such as population growth, agricultural growth,
industrial growth, GDP growth, and literacy.  They formulated a network model connecting the variables associated
to various nations, both by geographical proximity and diplomatic links. The PageRank algorithm was used to determine
the countries whose changes in human activity would have the greatest impact upon the earth's health.

Congratulations to <b> Vera Aelrod </b> for a RPI team member of  Mathematical Contest in Modeling, which is run by COMAP which won the

from the workforce, only a handful were students. There were mentors from many walks of the business field and the 
entire weekend was very educational with regards to entreprenuership. Even before winning, Dave Vorick was able to

anybody interested in entreprenuership.

        Poly has published (on December 12/8/2010) a very nice article on RPISEC during their CTF competition. Many members of RPISEC are also members of RCOS. There
        has been a lot of co-operation between RPISEC and RCOS - pooling the resources
        to achieve greater things. Ryan G, John McM, Alex Rad are mentioned by name
        in that article.

    A blurb fron that <a href= http://lwn.net/Articles/386321/> LWN site</a>
    <pre>
    Good presentations, and good presenters, are not a result of good software. 
    But bad presentation software can make creating a good presentation much 
    more challenging. Rather than complaining about poor presentation-ware, 
    Robert Carr and Amy Wieliczka have been working on Glide: a Clutter/GTK-based 
    presentation application to fill the gap.

    Sponsored by the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software, Glide is a 
    GNOME presentation program in its earliest stages. Glide is licensed 
    under the GPLv3, is written in Vala and C, and attempts to do away with 
    some of the baggage of standard presentation applications.
